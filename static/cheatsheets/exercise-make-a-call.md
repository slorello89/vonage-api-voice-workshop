# Cheatsheet: Make a Call

**Aim:** Have everyone phone their mobile (say "cellphone" if you are in the USA!) and feel like they achieved something :)

This exercise is based very directly on the related code snippets <https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/code-snippets/make-an-outbound-call-with-ncco> which should have correct placeholder information and dependencies as well as code.

There is a detailed "you will need" section. Most problems will be caused by:
 - not having a Nexmo account
 - not having a Nexmo number
 - not having created the application as described
 - not having the public key for the application
 - not having a working tech stack

The stretch goals are:

1. Change the spoken greeting, optionally with SSML
2. Configure the event_url to point to somewhere so you can see what is going on, either the event logger tool or there are requestbin alikes. Tip: try lornajane's requestbin fork on github to get a version that does deploy to Heroku without changes https://github.com/lornajane/requestbin
