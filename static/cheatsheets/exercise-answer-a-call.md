# Answer a Call

This is the second exercise after "Make a call", and the idea is to have the user make a call with their mobile to their Nexmo number and have their application respond to them .

This exercise on having a publicly-available URL for the local code. Ngrok is recommended.

This workshop based closedly on https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/code-snippets/receive-an-inbound-call

The stretch goal (in case anyone needs more entertainment) is to return something different. Something dynamic, or some audio.
