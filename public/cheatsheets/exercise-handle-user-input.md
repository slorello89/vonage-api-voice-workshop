# Exercise: Handle User Input

**Aim:** have a more interactive experience than just making and receiving calls. Attendees can build tiny versions of the applications they actually want to use.

This exercise based closely on https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/code-snippets/handle-user-input-with-dtmf

The user needs to get a call using an NCCO (doesn't matter if the call is coming in or going out) with an ``input`` action in it.

The URL specified must exist and be publicly available (see resources on ngrok if needed)

Stretch goals for this exercise (there probably won't be time but just in case!)

* Make your IVR do something more interesting than speak the number - I linked Tony's dial-a-carol as an example
* Record the call and download the recording (it's the thing I wanted to cover and didn't so people can try it if they are at a loose end)
